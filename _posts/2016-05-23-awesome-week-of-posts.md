This blog has been quiet for some time, and even when updated, not updated frequently.
I have still been listening to new music and its been stacking up a lot as I am also
fairly busy with other things.  But I also have a stack a new, good music that I am going
to release this week to bring back the Awesome Week of Posts.  I believe this might be the
third anniversary of AWP, so enjoy as the hits keep coming.
